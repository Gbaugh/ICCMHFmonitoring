# Target Setting for Monitoring Using Aggregate Datasets (ICCMHFmonitoring)
Tools for monitoring iCCM using aggregate Health Facility data

Problem: The programme monitoring databases and other HMISs such as DHIS2 contain data that is aggregated, usually at the health facility level.  This allows basic reporting, but the aggregation hides problems in the system.  

Proposal: Using a metadata for each Health Facility, target population and intervention, a modelled dataset can used to produce a probable result against which the monthly facility data can be compared.  For ICCM the number of CHWs, the target population, and basic epidemiological data can be used to produce a ‘target range’ for each indicator, such as the expected number of cases presenting.  This will allow for a deeper understanding of the data and more targeted interventions by health professionals.  


Supplemental activities necessary:
•	Routine periodic surveys to update assumptions caregiver behaviour, such as careseeking.  
•	Periodic register reviews of source data to identify problem CHWs and data quality


Facility X
1.	Total cachement area covered by CHWs
2.	Fever rates at different times of year
3.	Careseeking behaviour in endline survey
4.	(criteria to calculate range minimum and maximum)
a.	Calculate target, then review across health facilities
b.	Algorithm for using historical data (twelve months, one month)
c.	Standard deviation for each step
d.
